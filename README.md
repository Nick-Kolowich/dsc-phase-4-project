## Purpose
To build a forecast model for the prices of homes in Florida, in order to predict the best zip codes for investment over a 2 and 5 year horizon.

## Data Description

Crash data shows information about each traffic crash on city streets within the City of Chicago limits and under the jurisdiction of Chicago Police Department (CPD). The data contains information on 453,326 accidents occuring inside the Chicago City limits between 2015 and 2021. All crashes are recorded as per the format specified in the Traffic Crash Report, SR1050, of the Illinois Department of Transportation. <br/>

## Summary

Most of the accidents in Chicago are attributable to driver negligence, a broad category which encompasses things such as following too closely, failing to yield, improper turning, and many other traffic violations. The Chicago Traffic Management Authority (TMA) could potentially seek to reduce these occurrences by implementing harsher penalties for traffic violations. <br/>
 <br/>
There is a noticeable spike in accidents during commuting hours, both in the morning and evening. A potential solution to this might be to stagger business start times, to alleviate congestion on the roads during the mornings and evenings. For instance, the 8 hour work day could be shifted forward two hours for some businesses, starting at 11 and ending at 7, rather than the traditional 9-5.
